            <dt>browser</dt> <dd>The software integrates with one or more browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari) as opposed to the operating system or network.</dd>

            <dt>accountability</dt> <dd>The software notifies an accountability partner, parent, or spouse regarding Internet activity or filter configuration, typically over email but sometimes using another means such as RSS.</dd>
            <dt>antivirus</dt> <dd>The software is part of an antivirus product.  Most antivirus products come with some type of parental controls.</dd>
            <dt>biglist</dt> <dd>Filtering is accomplished through a large database of categorized resources.</dd>
            <dt>changedelay</dt> <dd>The software allows the end-user to configure it without a password, but will not allow the change to take effect for some amount of time.  The author knows of no filter that supports this other than Pluckeye.</dd>
            <dt>cloud</dt> <dd>The software interacts with data in the cloud.  E.g., a list of websites to block are retrieved from a remote server.</dd>
            <dt>countermeasures</dt> <dd>The software will notice and respond to attempts to work around it.  E.g., k9 can be configured to block all Internet access for a specified time if too many attempts to visit blocked pages are detected.</dd>
            <!-- <dt>dns</dt> <dd>The software works primarily through control over DNS.</dd> -->
            <!-- <dt>etchosts</dt> <dd>The software works by modifiying etchosts.</dd> -->

            <dt>games</dt> <dd>The software can block user access to other programs (typically this is used to limit game time).</dd>
            <dt>gateway</dt> <dd>The software is meant to be installed on a network router separate from the end-user machine.  In the case of a gateway filter on this page, the OS value lists all operating systems to reflect the fact that the end-user machine may have any operating system.  Such software is typically created for schools and employers.</dd>
            <dt>hardware</dt> <dd>The software comes preinstalled on a device that connects to and filters for the local network.</dd>
            <!-- <dt>icap</dt> <dd>The software is based on ICAP.</dd> -->
            <dt>incomplete</dt> <dd>The software describes itself as incomplete.</dd>
            <!-- <dt>iptables</dt> <dd>The software works primarily through control over routing tables.</dd> -->
            <!-- <dt>isp</dt> <dd>The service is marketed as an ISP.</dd> -->
            <dt>keyword</dt> <dd>Filtering is accomplished on the fly through keyword detection within web pages.</dd>
            <dt>locationtracking</dt> <dd>The location of the end-user is tracked and usually presented to another person (ostensibly the end-user's parent).</dd>
            <dt>mimetypes</dt> <dd>Filtering can be done on a mime type basis.  E.g., Pluckeye can block all images from http://craigslist.org/ , but still allow text.</dd>
            <dt>monitoring</dt> <dd>The software monitors Internet activity or filter settings for the purpose of allowing a parent, accountability partner, or other person to view.  See also accountability.</dd>
            <dt>more</dt> <dd>The software has other features that do not fit one of the other feature categories.</dd>
            <dt>motivate</dt> <dd>The software has motivational messages for the end-user.</dd>
            <dt>opensource</dt> <dd>The software is open source.</dd>
            <dt>opensource-contrib</dt> <dd>The software is open source to interested contributors.</dd>
            <dt>password</dt> <dd>The software allows or requires configuration to be protected by a password.</dd>
            <dt>pixelation</dt> <dd>The software uses computer vision algorithms to anaylze images and pixelates ones that contain too much skin.</dd>
            <dt>proxy</dt> <dd>The software is a proxy and requires browsers be configured to use it (note that this meaning is specific to this page).  See also gateway for another kind of proxy.</dd>
            <dt>ratings</dt> <dd>The software uses self-identifying website ratings such as as <a href="http://www.rtalabel.org/">RTA</a> and <a href="http://www.safesurf.com/ssplan.html">SafeSurf</a>.</dd>
            <dt>screenshots</dt> <dd>The software takes screenshots so that some other person can review what the user was doing.</dd>
            <dt>smarts</dt> <dd>The software tries to determine whether content should be allowed or not by examining content.  This is sometimes used in combination with biglist techniques and sometimes as an alternative.</dd>
            <dt>social</dt> <dd>The software specifically monitors interaction on social media sites such as Facebook, Google+, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Tumblr, and Twitter, etc., with the intent of informing a parent about how their child is interacting through these sites.</dd>
            <dt>spying</dt> <dd>The software spies on the user and generates reports for somebody else to look at.  Spying is similar to monitoring and accountability but distinct because filters that do spying are more invasive, often they go so far as to log key strokes.</dd>
            <dt>timer</dt> <dd>The software can be configured to enable or disable access to the Internet or parts of the Internet for a specified amount of time or time of day.</dd>

                <dt>underreports</dt> <dd>Users can view content that should be restricted, and the software doesn't report it.  This may include but is certainly not limited to image searches on www.google.com.</dd>
